Blast yield comes from ETH staking and RWA protocols. The yield from these decentralized protocols is passed back to Blast users automatically. The default interest rate on other L2s is 0%. On Blast, it’s 4% for ETH and 5% for stablecoins.


# Why a new L2
After the merge, Ethereum provides 4% yield on ETH. On-chain T-Bill protocols provide 5% yield on stablecoins. If users do not match or beat these rates, they are losing money to a form of inflation.

L2s today do not have this yield. Incorporating ETH and stablecoin yield natively requires a new L2 designed from the ground up. Blast is an EVM-compatible, optimistic rollup that raises the baseline yield for users and developers without changing the experience cryptonatives expect.

This yield makes it possible to create new business models for Dapps that aren’t possible on other L2s.
